# This script was written by John Galea
# It was written on Redhat 7.3
# it takes one directory on photoshow and copies it to photoprism
# the jpg is then modified using https://exiftool.org/
# which needs to be downloaded, end expanded
# the tool only copies jpg or JPG files
# the tool only does one directory at a time
# you can change where exiftool, photoshow and photoprism are located
# the files are originally processed in a temp directory and then renamed
# the descriptions are copied to a temp workspace
# the original photoshow directories are untouched
#
# set directory locations
